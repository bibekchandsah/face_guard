## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python face_guard.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Auto-Lock Settings
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle automatic screen locking
- **Screen Dim Delay**: 1-60 seconds before dimming when owner leaves
- **Lock Grace Period**: 5-300 seconds grace period before screen lock
- **Default**: 10 seconds dim delay, 40 seconds grace period

- **Face Recognition Sensitivity**: 50-95% strictness (70% recommended)
- **Gesture Thresholds**: Auto-calibrated or manually trained

### Security Timeline
1. **Owner Leaves**: Toast notification appears
2. **After Dim Delay**: Screen dims to 0% for privacy
3. **Grace Period**: 30-second countdown (if auto-lock enabled)
4. **Screen Lock**: Windows screen locks automatically
5. **Owner Returns**: System restores brightness and cancels auto-lock

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All face data stored in `face_guard_data/` folder
- **No External Connections**: No data sent to external servers
- **Mathematical Encodings**: Face data stored as mathematical vectors, not images
- **Easy Reset**: Delete face data anytime by removing the data folder
- **Unknown Face Images**: Stored locally for security review (optional)
- **Secure Auto-Lock**: Uses Windows native screen lock functionality

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Camera Issues
- **Camera Access**: Ensure no other applications are using the camera
- **Permissions**: Check camera permissions in your OS settings
- **Administrator**: Try running as administrator (Windows) if camera access fails
- **Performance**: Enable Performance Mode if camera preview is laggy

### Face Recognition Issues
- **Poor Recognition**: Adjust sensitivity slider (70% recommended)
- **Re-register Face**: Use "Reset Owner Face" button in camera preview
- **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting when registering your face
- **Multiple Faces**: App focuses on largest/closest face in frame

### Auto-Lock Issues
- **Not Locking**: Check that auto-lock is enabled in Settings
- **Wrong Timing**: Adjust dim delay and grace period in Settings
- **Manual Override**: Use Ctrl+Shift+R to restore brightness anytime

### Performance Issues
- **High CPU**: Enable Performance Mode (10 FPS instead of 15 FPS)
- **Lag**: Close other camera applications and reduce system load
- **Memory**: Restart application if running for extended periods

### Gesture Detection Issues
- **Poor Detection**: Use gesture training to record custom patterns
- **Calibration**: Use auto-calibration feature for optimal thresholds
- **Testing**: Use built-in test buttons to verify gesture recognition
