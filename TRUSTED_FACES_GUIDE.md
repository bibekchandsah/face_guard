# 👥 Trusted Faces Feature Guide

## Overview

The trusted faces feature allows the owner to add trusted individuals who won't trigger security alerts when detected by the camera. When a trusted face is detected, the system will:

- ✅ **Skip unknown face alerts** - No toast notifications about unknown faces
- ✅ **Skip brightness dimming** - Screen brightness remains normal
- ✅ **Log trusted face detection** - Still logs the detection for monitoring

## ✅ Implementation Status: **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

The trusted faces feature has been completely implemented with the following components:

### 🔧 Core Functionality
- **Face Storage**: Trusted faces are stored in `face_guard_data/trusted_faces.json`
- **Face Recognition**: Uses face_recognition library for accurate face matching
- **Detection Integration**: Integrated into main detection loop
- **Persistence**: Trusted faces persist across application restarts

### 🎯 Main Detection Logic
```python
# In the main detection loop (face_guard.py line ~1904):
if face_boxes and not owner_here:
    # Check if any detected face is trusted
    is_trusted, trusted_name = self.is_trusted_face(frame)
    
    if is_trusted:
        # Trusted face detected - no alert needed
        log(f"Trusted face detected: {trusted_name}")
        # Don't dim brightness or show alerts for trusted faces
    else:
        # Unknown face detected - proceed with normal security measures
        # ... (normal unknown face handling)
```

### 🖥️ User Interface
- **Add Trusted Face Button**: `👥 Add Trusted Face` in camera preview
- **Manage Trusted Faces Button**: `📋 Manage Trusted Faces` in camera preview
- **Management Dialog**: Full-featured dialog to view and remove trusted faces

## 🚀 How to Use

### Adding a Trusted Face
1. Open the camera preview window (Ctrl+Shift+C or system tray)
2. Have the trusted person position themselves in front of the camera
3. Click `👥 Add Trusted Face` button
4. Enter a name for the trusted person
5. Click OK - the system will capture and save their face encoding

### Managing Trusted Faces
1. Open the camera preview window
2. Click `📋 Manage Trusted Faces` button
3. View all trusted faces with their names and dates added
4. Select a face and click `🗑️ Remove Selected` to remove it
5. Click `🔄 Refresh` to update the list

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Face Recognition Threshold
- **Trusted face recognition threshold**: 0.6 (distance)
- **Same person detection threshold**: 0.6 (prevents duplicates)
- Uses face_recognition library's face_distance function

### File Structure
```json
{
    "faces": [
        {
            "name": "John Doe",
            "encoding": [128 floating point values],
            "added_date": "2025-09-01 12:34:56"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Core Functions
- `_load_trusted_faces()`: Load trusted faces from file on startup
- `_save_trusted_faces()`: Save trusted faces to file
- `add_trusted_face(frame, name)`: Add new trusted face from current frame
- `remove_trusted_face(name)`: Remove trusted face by name
- `is_trusted_face(frame)`: Check if any face in frame is trusted

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Duplicate Prevention
- System checks if a face is already registered before adding
- Uses face distance comparison to detect duplicates
- Prevents the same person from being added multiple times

### Face Quality Requirements
- Requires clear face detection in current frame
- Uses same face detection as owner registration
- Ensures high-quality face encodings for accurate recognition

### Logging
- All trusted face operations are logged
- Detection events are logged: `"Trusted face detected: [name]"`
- Management operations logged: `"Added trusted face: [name]"`

## 🧪 Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
python test_trusted_faces.py
```

Tests verify:
- File structure correctness
- face_recognition library availability
- Data persistence
- Core functionality

## 🔧 Requirements

- **face_recognition library**: Required for face encoding and comparison
- **OpenCV**: For face detection and image processing
- **NumPy**: For face encoding array operations

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Family Member
1. Add family member as "Mom" when she's in front of camera
2. System learns her face encoding
3. When she enters the room, no security alerts are triggered
4. System logs: "Trusted face detected: Mom"

### Example 2: Office Colleague
1. Add colleague as "Sarah - Coworker" 
2. During video calls or office visits, no false alarms
3. System continues monitoring for actual unknown faces
4. Trusted face detection doesn't interfere with owner detection

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Owner vs Trusted**: Owner detection still takes priority - if owner is present, no security measures activate regardless of other faces
2. **Multiple Faces**: System can detect multiple trusted faces in the same frame
3. **Performance**: Trusted face checking adds minimal overhead to detection loop
4. **Accuracy**: Uses same high-accuracy face recognition as owner detection

## ✅ Feature Complete

The trusted faces feature is **fully implemented and ready for use**. Users can:

- ✅ Add trusted faces through the UI
- ✅ Manage (view/remove) trusted faces through the UI  
- ✅ Benefit from automatic trusted face detection
- ✅ Avoid false alarms from known individuals
- ✅ Maintain full security for actual unknown faces

The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing security system while providing the flexibility to whitelist known individuals.
