## 🎯 Final Refined Master Prompt

*"Build a Python-based GUI application with the following features:*

### 1. **Face Detection & User Registration**

* On the **first startup**, capture and register the user’s face.
* Save the face encoding so the system remembers the user across future sessions.
* Continuously monitor webcam input to detect faces in real-time.
* If a **new/unknown face** (not the registered user) is detected, trigger the brightness confirmation process.

### 2. **Brightness Control**

* When a new face is detected, brightness should only reduce to **25%** after confirmation.
* Provide an **override hotkey** (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+R`) to instantly restore brightness to normal.

### 3. **Gesture-Based Confirmation**

* **Nod Up & Down Twice (Yes gesture)** → Confirm brightness reduction.
* **Shake Left & Right (No gesture)** → Cancel brightness reduction.
* Use **Mediapipe (face landmarks)** to track head movements.

### 4. **Visual Indicators & Notifications**

* Show a **floating notification** only when an event occurs (e.g., “Unknown face detected”, “Waiting for gesture confirmation”, “Brightness reduced”).
* Display a **green icon** when nod detected (confirmation) and a **red icon** when shake detected (cancellation).

### 5. **Logs**

* Maintain **real-time logs** in the GUI (e.g., “User face recognized”, “Unknown face detected”, “Gesture = Nod”, “Brightness reduced to 25%”).

### 6. **Technical Details**

* Use **OpenCV** for video capture and face recognition.
* Use **Mediapipe** for gesture/head movement detection.
* Use **screen-brightness-control** (Windows/Linux) or `pyobjc` (macOS) for brightness adjustment.
* Lightweight, real-time performance.
* GUI should be simple and floating (Tkinter/PyQt).
